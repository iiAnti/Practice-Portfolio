                        I started out as a young guy who only knew hard work and payment. I've always liked coding, but never actually thought it could be a possibility for me to follow a career in it. In all honesty the main pursuite came when I was a show called "Mr.Robot". Sounds cringy, I know. It actually pushed me to pursue coding. On top of that I produce music and game. I believe having the skills of a Dev., music producer, and even gaming will help me all around.
